4. **Set up the network device credentials and configurations** (if necessary):
    - Configure your devices and network access credentials before running the automation scripts.

## Usage

### Running Network Automation Scripts

To run a Python script for network automation (e.g., configuring a device):

1. Ensure you have network access to the device you want to configure.
2. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python network_automation_script.py
    ```

### Running Network Monitoring or Troubleshooting Scripts

For network monitoring (e.g., checking device uptime, performing ping tests):

1. Run the monitoring script:
    ```bash
    python network_monitoring.py
    ```
